# Linux Program Collection

A collection of C/C++/Bash programs using the Linux Programming API I have
written for various assignments. Contains the following:

## `adventure`

A very simple text adventure game that creates a labyrinth of rooms and saves
and loads them to and from text files. After compilation (`cd adventure;
make`), just run `./bin/adventure`, intermediate files are saved to a newly
created directory in the current working directory.

## `find`

A simplified clone of the UNIX `find` command supporting the following syntax:

```
find <directory name> [-name <pattern>] [-type <f | d>] [-follow] [-xdev]
```

The `name` option accepts wildcards.

## `matrix`

A bash script that performs common matrix operations. After compilation
(`cd matrix; make`), execute `./bin/matrix` without any arguments to display a
usage message.

## `one_time_pad`

A set of client server programs which implement the one-time-pad encryption
scheme. Compile with `cd one_time_pad; make`. Then generate a random key of
length greater than a plaintext to be encoded with `./bin/keygen KEY_LENGTH`,
then start encryption and decyption server and assign them to free ports of
your choice with `./bin/otp_enc_d PORT_ENC &`, `./bin/otp_dec_d PORT_DEC &`.
Afterwards encrypt arbitrary plaintext and decrypt them again with
`./bin/otp_enc PLAINTEXT_FILE KEY_FILE PORT_ENC` and `./bin/otp_dec
CIPHERTEXT_FILE KEY_FILE PORT_DEC` where `PLAINTEXT_FILE` must only contain
uppercase letters and spaces and `KEY_FILE` was generated by `./bin/keygen`.
Also make sure that the ports match.

## `shell`

A simple shell supporting commands with the following syntax:

```
command <args> [< input_redirect] (| command <args>)* [> output_redirect] [&]
```

as well as the following builtins:

* `cd`
* `pwd`
* `kill <signo> <pid>`
* `alias/unalias`

Some features implemented by the shell that are not (directly) part of the
exercise task specification include:

* automatic lookup of programs in directories that are part of `$PATH`

* execution of scripts starting with a shebang

* wildcard expansion (not exhaustively tested)

* `SIGINT`, `SIGTSTP` and `SIGQUIT` handling
